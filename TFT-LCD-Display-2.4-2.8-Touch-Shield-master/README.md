# TFT-LCD-Display-2.4-2.8-Touch-Shield
Simple demo sketch to show how to use a SPFD5408-based TFT LCD 2.4" or 2.8" Touch Screen. See video #83 here: https://www.youtube.com/c/RalphBacon

Using a colour touch screen may seem daunting but with the right library and example code it can add a WOW factor to your projects.
  
I'll show you how to get started with a very popular variant of the TFT touch screen, including how to make a "button" (spoiler alert: it's not a button just an area of screen that looks like one, that you can then receive touches from). 
  
It's cheap, easy and allows you to dispense with physical buttons and switches on your project's front panel too!
